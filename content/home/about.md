# About

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where I teach undergraduate students in the Programs in [Educational Studies](https://commons.trincoll.edu/educ/) and [Public Policy & Law](https://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/Policy/).

I conduct qualitative research on school choice policies, focusing on their possibilities for, and limitations to, advancing racially equitable and democratic public education. As an interdisciplinary scholar, I employ concepts from political science, sociology, and critical policy analysis.  

My current research examines Asian American parents in Greater Hartford, Connecticut, who choose magnet schools for their children and the extent to which their choices are informed by racial integration considerations. In addition, with support from the [Spencer Foundation](https://www.spencer.org/news/announcing-our-covid-19-related-research-grants-awardees), I am working with Dr. Mira Debs and Dr. Molly Vollman Makris to study how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted school integration organizing and activism in New York City, where school choice has exacerbated racial segregation over the last two decades. Other research examines progressive and community-based charter schools, the experiences of students of color with disabilities in charter schools, and the politics surrounding policymakers' use of research.  

My work has been published in *American Journal of Education*, *Education Policy Analysis Archives*, *Educational Policy*, *Peabody Journal of Education*, and *Urban Education*. I had the honor of discussing my work on the [Have You Heard](https://soundcloud.com/haveyouheardpodcast/progressive-charters) podcast as the winner of their inaugural Graduate Student Research Contest.
