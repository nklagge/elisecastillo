# About

Hi, I'm Dr. Elise Castillo:

<br> 

I am an [Assistant Professor of Educational Studies](https://internet3.trincoll.edu/facProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1200195) at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.

I conduct qualitative research on school choice policies, focusing on their possibilities for, and limitations to, advancing racially integrated, equitable, and democratic public education. As an interdisciplinary scholar, I employ concepts from political science, sociology, and critical policy analysis.

I have a particular interest in understanding how diverse Asian American students and families experience and make sense of school choice and integration policies. My work examines this topic in Greater Hartford, Connecticut, and New York City.

Related work examines the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s impact on school integration organizing in New York City, where school choice has exacerbated segregation over the last two decades; and how progressive and community-based charter schools can advance or hinder racial equity and integration.

My work has been published in various academic journals, including *American Journal of Education*; *Education Policy Analysis Archives*; and *Race, Ethnicity, and Education*. In addition, I have shared my work with broader audiences in *The Connecticut Mirror* and the *Have You Heard* podcast.

Prior to my academic career, I taught middle and high school English in New York City public schools.
