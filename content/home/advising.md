### How to request a reference or recommendation letter

*Adapted, with thanks, from [Dr. Jack Dougherty's advice](https://jackdougherty.org/letter/) to students.

**I am on leave during the 2023-2024 academic year. If you would like to request a reference or recommendation letter from me, you must email me your request AND send me the materials described below by <ins>October 1, 2023</ins>.**

For students whom I have gotten to know as their professor and/or advisor, I am usually very willing to serve as a reference or to write a letter of recommendation for employment opportunities and graduate school. (If you are interested in the latter, I encourage you to read [Dr. Jack Dougherty’s excellent advice on graduate school](https://jackdougherty.org/grad-school/).) 

That said, please think carefully about what I can and cannot address as your reference or in a recommendation letter. For example, if a potential employer wants specific information about your ability to work with young children, and I have never observed you doing so, I am probably not the best choice for you.

To request a reference or recommendation letter, here is how to proceed:

**To request listing me as a reference:**

* Send me an email stating that you wish to list me as a reference. This usually means that you will provide my name and contact information, and someone from an organization will contact me.  

* In your email, include the name of the person or organization that might contact me, and a description and/or website about the position or program.

**To request a recommendation letter:**  

* Writing a recommendation letter requires more work from both me and you. <u>Please give me at least two weeks' advance notice.</u> I also encourage you to come to my office hours to discuss your plans with me.  

* Email me your request, and include either:

  + A 1–2 paragraph response addressing the question, "Why are you and this program a good match for one another?" or

  + A draft of your personal statement for the application. Reading your words helps me to tailor my letter for your audience.

* Please also send me your resume.

* Include clear instructions about the deadline and where to send my letter. Some programs request that I email it directly to them, whereas others require you to complete an online form that automatically sends me a link to upload your letter.

**Finally, please keep me posted on the outcome of your application!**
