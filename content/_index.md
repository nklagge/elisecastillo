I study the political and social dimensions of public education policymaking, particularly regarding market-oriented education reforms, such as charter schools and other forms of school choice. I am interested in how education policies and advocacy processes related to market-based reforms impact educational equity and democracy, particularly among minoritized communities. My recent research examines progressive and community-based charter schools, the experiences of students of color with disabilities in charter schools, and the politics surrounding policymakersâ€™ use of research. My work has been featured on the [Have You Heard](https://soundcloud.com/haveyouheardpodcast/progressive-charters) podcast.

I am the [Ann Plato Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow](http://internet2.trincoll.edu/FacProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1200195) at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. At Trinity, I am affiliated with the Programs in Educational Studies and Public Policy & Law.

I received my Ph.D in Education Policy from the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, I taught middle and high school English in New York City and worked as a policy research assistant at Teachers College, Columbia University. I received my BA in English and Creative Writing from Barnard College, my MS in Teaching (Adolescent English) from Pace University, and my MA in Education Policy from UC Berkeley.
