I am a doctoral candidate in the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on the political and social dimensions of public education policymaking, especially regarding market-oriented education reforms. I am interested in how education policymaking and advocacy processes impact educational equity and democracy, particularly among nondominant communities.

Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, I taught middle and high school English in New York City and worked as a policy research assistant at Teachers College, Columbia University. I received my BA in English and Creative Writing from Barnard College, my MS in Teaching (Adolescent English) from Pace University, and my MA in Education Policy from UC Berkeley.
