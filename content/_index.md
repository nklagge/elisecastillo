I received my Ph.D in Education Policy from the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on the political and social dimensions of public education policymaking, especially regarding market-oriented education reforms, such as charter schools and other forms of school choice. I am interested in how education policymaking and advocacy processes impact educational equity and democracy, particularly among minoritized communities.

I am currently a qualitative researcher at New York University's [Metro Center](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/metrocenter/). During the 2019-2020 academic year, I will be the Ann Plato Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. At Trinity, I will be affiliated with the Programs in Educational Studies and Public Policy & Law.

Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, I taught middle and high school English in New York City and worked as a policy research assistant at Teachers College, Columbia University. I received my BA in English and Creative Writing from Barnard College, my MS in Teaching (Adolescent English) from Pace University, and my MA in Education Policy from UC Berkeley.
