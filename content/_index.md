I received my Ph.D in Education Policy from the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on the political and social dimensions of public education policymaking, especially regarding market-oriented education reforms. I am interested in how education policymaking and advocacy processes impact educational equity and democracy, particularly among nondominant communities.

I am currently working as a researcher at the [Metro Center](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/metrocenter/) at New York University.

Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, I taught middle and high school English in New York City and worked as a policy research assistant at Teachers College, Columbia University. I received my BA in English and Creative Writing from Barnard College, my MS in Teaching (Adolescent English) from Pace University, and my MA in Education Policy from UC Berkeley.
