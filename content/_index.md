I am the [Ann Plato Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow](http://internet2.trincoll.edu/FacProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1200195) at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where I am affiliated with the Programs in Educational Studies and Public Policy & Law. Beginning in Fall 2020, I will be a Visiting Assistant Professor at Trinity College.

I conduct qualitative research on the political and social dimensions of school choice policies and other market-based educational reforms. I am particularly interested in how school choice and market-based reforms impact racial equity and democracy. My current research examines how Asian American families choose schools for their children and the degree to which they consider racial integration and equity in doing so. Other recent research examines progressive and community-based charter schools, the experiences of students of color with disabilities in charter schools, and the politics surrounding policymakers' use of research. My work has been featured on the [Have You Heard](https://soundcloud.com/haveyouheardpodcast/progressive-charters) podcast.

I received my Ph.D in Education Policy from the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, I taught middle and high school English in New York City and worked as a policy research assistant at Teachers College, Columbia University. I received my BA in English and Creative Writing from Barnard College, my MS in Teaching (Adolescent English) from Pace University, and my MA in Education Policy from UC Berkeley.
