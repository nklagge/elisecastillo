I am a former member of the editorial board of the [Berkeley Review of Education](http://www.berkeleyreviewofeducation.com/), an open-access, peer-reviewed journal edited by students at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Between 2013 and 2018, I held multiple roles on the BRE board, including co-chief editor.
