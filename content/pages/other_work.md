I am a former member of the editorial board of the [Berkeley Review of Education](http://www.berkeleyreviewofeducation.com/), an open-access, peer-reviewed journal edited by students at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Between 2013 and 2018, I held multiple roles on the BRE board, including co-chief editor.

During my time in New York, I volunteered with the Alliance for School Integration and Desegregation, a grassroots group advocating for racial and socioeconomic integration across New York City's public schools. I also served as a qualitative research consultant at New York Universityâ€™s Metro Center.
