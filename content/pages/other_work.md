I am on the editorial board of the [Berkeley Review of Education](http://www.berkeleyreviewofeducation.com/), an open-access, peer-reviewed journal edited by students at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. Since 2013, I have held multiple roles on the BRE board, including co-chief editor.
